This is a py program which may detect the USB device and do sth.(lock, etc.)

It will detect if the specifited device exists.

For my code, it's an iPhone 6S whose PID==4776. You may change it to any PID you want.

For my code, if the device is not found, it will lock your screen.
You can simply change the content between begin func and end func to have other functions like make the computer runs slowly or loses network connection.
